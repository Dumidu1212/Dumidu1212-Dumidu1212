## 🧠 About Me

I'm a final-year **Software Engineering undergraduate** with deep experience in both **AI product development** and **real-world software systems**. My passion lies in building **agentic, modular, and scalable applications**  whether it's automating PDF comprehension with **Groq + Agno**, designing smart healthcare systems, or deploying microservice-based infrastructures.

🌍 Based in **Sri Lanka**  
💼 Currently building agentic AI tools using **Groq, Agno, OpenAI, pgvector**  
🛠️ Skilled in: `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `React`, `Java`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Docker`, `OSGi`, `Flutter`, `Firebase`
