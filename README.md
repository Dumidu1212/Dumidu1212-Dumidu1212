## 🧠 About Me

I am a Software Engineer passionate about combining agentic AI architectures with system level engineering. My work spans from building self refining AI assistants using Groq + Agno to experimenting with operating system development in C and Assembly.

I thrive in creating solutions that are both intelligent and efficient — whether it’s an AI powered PDF assistant, a multi language code analyzer, or a custom OS kernel project.

🌍 Based in **Sri Lanka**  
💼 Currently developing agentic AI tools and exploring Linux kernel & OS fundamentals  
🛠️ Skilled in: `C`, `C++`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `React`, `Java`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Docker`, `OSGi`, `Flutter`, `Firebase`
